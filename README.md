> What if literary or historical figures sold apps?

## Banterian

Aside from plays and poetry, which aren't very useful, Shakespeare is famous for his insults, which can indeed be useful for alienating people. And so, if Shakespeare lived in our modern age, it is conceivable that he might have sold an app designed to disparage further notifications from noisy contacts.

The goal here was to create something simple and light that demonstrates the purpose of Shakespeare's product hopefully within seconds of the page loading. With any luck the call to action will trigger yet further insults (because anyone willing to download an app that automates insulting your contacts probably deserves their own Shakespearian witticism.)

This page does not use any frameworks—just vanilla CSS and a bit of JavaScript. The user names and profile pictures are pulled from randomuser.me's API—I rather suspect that the individuals who agree to provide their photos didn't anticipate that it would result in their likeness being insulted by Shakespeare.
